#Assignment 3: Collecting and Mapping Event-based Observations

#Description
#-brief summary of assignment

#Learning Objectives
# Collect event-based observation data in the field
# Demonstrate knowledge on first-order versus second-order processes
# Perform point pattern analyses using nearest neighbour and quadrat analysis
# Visualize patterns using kernel density estimation and k-means clustering

#Step 1: Data Collection
# With your group, collect data on the location of each large tree (>60 cm circumfrance at breast height) on campus within the study area provided in the map below
# Create a .csv data set with the following variables: ID, Latitude, Longitude, Species, Circumference

#Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
# Open the .csv file in R and view the first few lines of code to ensure that the file as opened accordingl

#Step 3: Plot the observation locations
plot()
#Add a title to the plot
#Add labels for latitude and longitude
#Change the symbols of the observation locations to circles at a size of ???
#Change the colours for the circles to represent the circumference of each tree
#Export your plot as a PDF

##Step 4: Spatializing your data
#Convert the .csv file to a spatialpointsdataframe
#Project your data using a suitable projection

#Step 5: Mapping your data
#Open shapefile of campus and surrounding area
#Add the spatailpointsdataframe of tree locations on top of campus data
#Change colour to represent the circumference of each tree
#Add a legend
#Add a scale bar

# Step 6: Create report
#We will provide a template for them to produce report in R markdown that will include:
#background
#data collection methodology
#plot and map
#description of spatial pattern at global and local scale
